## Absolute - Credential Manager : Privacy policy

Welcome to the Absolute - Credential Manager app for Android!

This is a closed source Android app developed by Estuosity (Prajwal BC). This app is listed and available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (like app preferences, theme, storage, etc) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

Yours sincerely,
